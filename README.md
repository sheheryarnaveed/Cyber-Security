##  **Computer System Security-COMP-0116**
This repository contains the assignments given to me in the Computer System Security Course(COMP-0116), taught by Professor Ming Chow, in Tufts University, and my solutions to those assignments. There were pretty fun activities that I did in this course as my assignments making this course both more productive and enjoyable for me. The course covers a wide arena of common security issues and ways to tackle those.

### Gains:
Some of the many things(tools, services, concepts, terminology etc. etc.) that I learned from the course especially its assignments include the following:

- VeraCode and VirusTotal
- NIKTO, FIN, NULL, XMAS
- SHODAN and NMAP
- Python Liraries: scapy, pcapy
- Common Weakness Enumeration(CWE), Common Vulnerabilities Exposures(CVE)
- Technical Risk Analysis Report Writeup
- Analysis of Malwares and Vulnerabilities in Web App
- BurpSuite
- SQLMap
- Wireshark and pcap files
- Jd-GUI
- Kali Linux
- John The Ripper and hashcat
- Hashes: MD5, SHA256, SHA512, NTLM

  <em>....much more!<em>


### Insights
It was after this course that I came to understand some really serious security problems which people can run into and how easy it is for intruders to leak data if special measures are not taken. Also, I understood the crux of different types of attacks and scanning techniques to identify scams. 
It's not a joke that a single file, which appeared to be a copletely normal file, download can lead to one's PC being controlled by a hacker. I am dead serious! And it is important to realise that the use of internet in daily life has increased to such an extent that plethora of people are unaware of such dangerous actions which can compromise their privacy without even having them knowing that it is happening. Similarly, web development is very common but it should be presumed that without security measures or a single vulnerability can bring the whole system down. Ufortunately, many web developers are unfamiliar with such vital issues that we face today. Thus I am glad the course was an eye opener for me and helped me learned things I should've learned being a CompSci major before I can became a victim of such attacks.
